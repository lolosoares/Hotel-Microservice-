This work was done as a conclusion to a course on Service, Microservice and DevOps within the scope of the iCT4Dev project.
My goal was to create a type of microservices that would be able to store information about jobs, work and people looking for work.
It was a simple idea just to consolidate new knowledge.
To test, clone the repository and use: "docker-compose build" to build the image and "docker-compose up" to run it.
Have fun analyzing the code.
